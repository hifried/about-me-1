         No, I did not ride a horse to school.</p>
    <p id="funStuff"> I really enjoy playing golf, but find it extremely frustrating. <br>
        I love scuba diving,  but when I am underwater I breathe heavy and quickly run out of air. <br>
        I find hardwork and problem-solving very gratifying.</p>  
    <p id="otherStuff">I will try everything once.</p>
